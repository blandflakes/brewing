##Notes

Brewed in Summer of 2014. Turned out delicious. Very clear and flavorful.
Bottle quality was inconsistent, but for the most part good.
The overall hop count here was probably 3/5 the amount recommended
in the source recipes, but any more probably would have been too
much for me.

Brewed in Fall of 2014. Used hops rather than pellets. On bottling (2014/11/19), lacked taste. Hopefully will taste better after bottle conditioning, but I'm not hopeful. Probably should have either used more hops or used the pellets.
