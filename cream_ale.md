#Cream Ale Extract Version
##Ingredients

* 3.3 lbs Extra Light Liquid Malt Extract
* 2.0 lbs Pilsen Dry Malt Extract, 15 min
* 1.0 pound Cane Sugar, 15 min
* 1.25 oz Willamette Hops, 60 min (bittering)
* 1.0 oz Willamette Hops, 10 min (aroma)
* Nottingham Ale Yeast

##Instructions

1. Bring 2.5 gallons of water to boil.
2. Add Liquid Malt extract.
3. Add ingredients at times provided.
4. Filter into fermenter after 60 minutes.

##Alterations
* Add 3 oz (or more) Vanilla extract before bottling.
* Rerack with Oranges to make an Orange Cream Ale.
* Try Wyeast 1010 (American Wheat) or 1056 (American Ale)
* Alternatively, try a lager yeast (maybe American Lager)

##Notes
###First brewing (date unknown)

* This looks solid when reracking.
* With Wyeast 1056, The fermentation was low-profile -
no real airlock activity and it was over within a week
(measured with hydrometer)
* Again with 1056, the yeast doesn't fall out very well - lots of things
floating around. Hopefully secondary clears it up.
* Adding the vanilla extract seemed overkill. Consider making this same recipe without the vanilla extract, as everything else seems pretty good.
* Yeast turned out sufficiently clear in secondary.

###Second brewing (2014-10-19)

* Used Irish Moss
* Used Nottingham Ale Dry Yeast
* Did not use any vanilla or fruit flavoring
