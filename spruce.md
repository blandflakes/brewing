#Spruce (extract)

##Ingredients (5 gallons)
* 6.6 lbs of dark LME
* 4 oz spruce tips
* 2 oz Vanguard or Hallertauer hops
* American Ale Yeast

##Alterations

Couldn't get the required hops, so went with Mt. Hood.

##Notes

Brewed 2014-12-21. Smells awesome. Used Wyeast 1056.

Bottled 2014-1-18. Tasted great, if not overly strong. Primed using 1.25 cups dark malt extract powder.

Tasted sometime early February. The flavor is excellent, though the beer falls flat. 1.25 cups (as recommended by *The Complete Joy of Homebrewing) seems insufficient.
