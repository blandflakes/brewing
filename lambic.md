From: [Extract Recipe](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=322168)

##Ingredients


###5 Gallons
* 3 lb Golden Light DME
* 3 lb Wheat DME
  * 4 oz Maltodextrin
* 2 oz aged hops (also called lambic hops)
* Wyeast 3278 Belgian Lambic Blend

##Instructions
1. Bring water to a boil, add malt, hops.
2. Boil for 60 minutes.
3. With 15 minutes remaining, add maltodextrin
4. Reduce temperature, pitch yeast
5. Leave in primary for at least a month.
6. Rack to secondary

##Alterations
* Rack over fruit
* Rather than use lambic blend, sour via suggestions in TCJOHB or via separate bacteria cultures.

##Notes
Brewed 2014-11-08, used Irish Moss, racked to 5 gallon bucket.

Reracked first brewing on 2014-12-21.  Tastes delicious.

Brewed another batch 2014-12-20, directly into a carboy.

Reracked batch #1 again on 2015-04-10, splitting into five 1-gallon carboys.

For fruit, used ~1 pound each of:
* raspberries/blackberries
* plums
* cherries (maraschino, unfortunately, but we'll see)
* aronia

And did one gallon plain.

On 2015-08-05, bottled each of the raspberry, cherry, aronia, and plain sours. Used 1.5 oz of DME for priming.
