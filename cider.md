#"Cyser" (experiment)
##Ingredients

* 4 gallons cider (no sulphur present)
* 1 gallon honey
* 1/2 gallon spring water
* Wyeast 1028 London Ale (for this batch)
* 5 tablespoons cinnamon powder

##Instructions

1. Mix all that shit together. Maybe heat the honey in some cider
(I don't know, I'm just making this up as I go).
2. Pour that shit in a 6.5 gallon bucket. Mix well.
3. Pitch yeast at ~70 degrees.
4. Let that shit sit for 1-2 weeks.
5. Rerack that mofo to secondary.
6. Add cinnamon powder. Or add it in step 1. Whatever.
7. Let sit for ALAP (the opposite of ASAP)
8. Mix up a priming solution, bottle.

##Notes

* It took a while to see any fermentation activity, leading me to believe
that I'd screwed something up. After about 60 hours, I saw activity, and
it's been bubbling since.
* This was actually very easy... if it turns out well, I'll make more meads.
