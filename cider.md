#Hard Cider, version 1
##Ingredients

* 5 gallons cider (no sulphur present)
* Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan (brew store never has the right yeast)

##Instructions

1. Pour juice in bucket
2. Add yeast
3. Consider cold crashing after fermentation slows to preserve sweetness (maybe not necessary with this yeast due to low alcohol tolerance)
