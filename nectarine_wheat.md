#Nectarine Wheat
Similar to "Hefeweisen". Goal is for a fast-ferment with fruit.

##Ingredients

* 5 lbs wheat DME
* 8 oz Caramel Light
* 1 oz any noble hop
* Wyeast 3056, 3068, or 3638
* 5-7 lbs of nectarines

##Instructions

1. Steep grains for 20 minutes
1. Bring to a boil. Add hops and 2 lbs DME.
1. With 10 minutes left in the boil, add 3 lbs DME.
1. Cool, pitch yeast
1. Ferment for ~7 days, add fruit
1. Keg or bottle when gravitry stops changing.

##Notes

Brewed on 2015-07-04. Used Wyeast 3638 because of its fast fermentation and spicy/fruity notes. Hops were Tettnang. Used a blowoff tube out of fear of explosion with active fermentation.
