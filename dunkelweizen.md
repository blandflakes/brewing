# Dunkelweizen
Slightly modified from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1lvidb/brewed_up_a_dunkelweizen_very_happy_with_the/).

## Ingredients
* 6 lb wheat DME
* 4 oz brown sugar
* 8 oz American chocolate
* 8 oz  Munich light 10L
* 1 oz Tettnanger (60 min)
* 0.5 oz Tettnanger (30 min)
* Wyeast 3068 or Wyeast 3638

## Notes
Brewed on 2015-09-16. Found some midnight wheat, which I added for darkness. Made 5 gallons, and split the batch so that 2.5 gallons were on 3068 and 2.5 were on 3638. Forgot the brown sugar, like an idiot.

Kegged around 2015-10-20. On tasting, the 3068 was clearly fruitier, though almost had too much going on. The 3638 tasted more like what I'd hope for in a Dunkel.
