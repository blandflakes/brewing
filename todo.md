#Equipment/Techniques:

- Try lagering
- Try partial or full mash

#Issues to resolve
##Astringent Taste
Consistently appears in nearly every brew. Cream Ale doesn't suffer as much for it...

###Candidates:
* Oxidizing (stopped reracking to secondary, but I autosiphon so that shouldn't be it)
* Adding hops too early (according to a random thread, the malt must be present first).
* Water - could just be chlorine or similar. Going to try Campden tablets.

##Low Starting Gravity
I need to measure this more consistently, but I think my Original Gravities are starting relatively low. I measured my Rauchbier before much fermentation was underway and got only 1.020. It's possible that more fermentation than I thought had completed, or it's possible that I have little malt.

###Solutions:
1. Measure 3 gallon and 5 gallon marks on carboys (to avoid putting too much water in)
2. Be sure to properly mix sugar and extra water
3. Always take the reading
4. If #3 shows consistently low OG, start adding more malt.
