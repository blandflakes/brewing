#Equipment/Techniques:

- Try lagering
- Try partial or full mash

#Issues to resolve
##Astringent Taste
Consistently appears in nearly every brew. Cream Ale doesn't suffer as much for it...

Candidates:
* Oxidizing (stopped reracking to secondary, but I autosiphon so that shouldn't be it)
* Adding hops too early (according to a random thread, the malt must be present first).
* Water - could just be chlorine or similar. Going to try Campden tablets.
