#Nectarine Wheat
Similar to "Hefeweisen". Goal is for a fast-ferment with fruit.

##Ingredients

* 5 lbs wheat DME
* 8 oz Caramel Light
* 1 oz any noble hop
* Wyeast 3056, 3068, or 3638
* 5-7 lbs of nectarines

##Instructions

1. Steep grains for 20 minutes
1. Bring to a boil. Add hops and 2 lbs DME.
1. With 10 minutes left in the boil, add 3 lbs DME.
1. Cool, pitch yeast
1. Ferment for ~7 days, add fruit
1. Keg or bottle when gravitry stops changing.

##Notes

Brewed on 2015-07-04. Used Wyeast 3638 because of its fast fermentation and spicy/fruity notes. Hops were Tettnang. Used a blowoff tube out of fear of explosion with active fermentation.

On 2015-07-15, took 10 lbs of frozen apricots and quartered them. Split them across two 3 gallon carboys. However, when moving the 5 gallon carboy containing the wheat to rerack it onto the apricots, I dropped it and lost the batch.

On 2015-07-18, went to the brew store and acquired ingredients to try again. They had no 3638, so I went with Wyeast 3068. To combat an overwhelming banana flavor, I'm attempting to make a starter from the last wheat I did, which I believe is Wyeast 3068. Hopefully the dual-yeast fermentation will stick to a variety of flavors. Once the starter is ready, I will rebrew. The 3 gallon carboys with apricots are in the freezer.
