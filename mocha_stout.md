##Notes

Brewed 2014-11-25. Went easier on the listed grains. However, had an additional grain, as I didn't find the Coffee Malt until I'd already found a potential subsitute.

Grain counts:

* 11.5 oz Crystal 120
* 8 oz Black Patent
* 12 oz Chocolate
* 12 oz Roasted Barley (intended as a placeholder for Coffee Malt)
* 12 oz Coffee Malt

Also used WLP004 (White Labs Irish Ale) as the store didn't have Wyeast Irish Ale.

Also threw in 8 oz of maltodextrin that I had lying around.
2014-11-30: Accidentally mistook for sour and reracked without cacao or coffee. Poured in lambic yeast on reracking (we'll see how this turns out).
2014-12-18: Compare with [McAustin's Mocha Stout](www.homebrewtalk.com/f68/mcaustins-mocha-stout-w-cold-brewed-coffee-27958/)
2014-12-21: Identified the mistake, added cacao and coffe, Will see how it tastes at the new year.
