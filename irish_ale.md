##Notes
Brewed 2015-01-24. Forgot irish moss, so we'll see how that goes.

Bottled 2015-02-27. Irish moss is definitely a requirement with this yeast. Very cloudy. Tastes nice and malty, though is lighter than I would want a red to be.

Sampled the bottled brew around 2015-03-17. Tasted VERY bitter. Not sure what went wrong between bottling and sampling. Letting it sit for a while longer. The drink was also very cloudy with yeast - definitely use Irish Moss next time.
